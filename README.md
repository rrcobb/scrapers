#Some Simple Web Scrapers

All in ruby, some useful to me, none very complicated. Using a few different gems - open-uri, crack, nokogiri, rest-client. gem install (whichever is required) if you are getting an error when running one of these. 

If you need help automating a web task, like if you are copying and pasting from the web regularly, message me and we can figure out a way to save you some mindless tedium. None of these scrapers is likely to work for your particular task, but they are decent real-world examples. 

Also, check out the [Bastard's Book of Ruby][bastard] - code samples, walkthroughs, and strong motivating stories for learning to wrassle data.
